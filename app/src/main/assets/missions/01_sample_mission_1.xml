<!-- A mission example consisting of a complete interaction. First, the player is welcomed to the
game and given context and a challenge (spoken text moment.)  Then, the player runs for 1.5
minutes (timer moment.)  Next, the player is notified that a zombie is now chasing them (spoken text
moment) and must choose one of two ways to defeat the zombie (choice moment.)  Finally, the user
learns the effectiveness of their choice (zombie defeated or not) (sfx moment and spoken text
moment) and is notified that they have arrived at the base (spoken text moment.) -->

            Welcome to Games In Motion!  The year is 2012, and the apocalypse is upon us in the form
            of zombies.  The zombies have decided that your brain looks particularly tasty, and a
            swarm is after you.  You will be pursued relentlessly until you reach the base, which is
            approximately 3 minutes away by foot.  You will be notified when a zombie begins to
            chase you, and you will have to react appropriately.  Keep an eye on your wrist gadget,
            but don't run into any trees, or else the zombies will surely catch you.  Good luck!
            Start running now!  You have at least a minute before a zombie will begin to chase you.

            You are now being chased!  Your options are as follows: Number 1. Act like a zombie in
            order to blend in.  Number 2.  Throw an axe at the zombie.  Make your choice using your
            mobile device.  Choose wisely.
