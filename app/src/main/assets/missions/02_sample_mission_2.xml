            Hello Agent. Welcome to Games In Motion!  The year is 2012, and the apocalypse is upon
            us in the form of zombies. Your task is to make it to our base. But the zombies have
            decided that your brain looks particularly tasty, and a swarm is after you.  You will be
            pursued relentlessly until you reach the base, which is approximately 20 minutes away by
            foot. Keep an eye on your wrist gadget: you will be notified when a zombie begins to
            chase you, and you will have to react appropriately. Don’t run into any trees, or else
            the zombies will surely catch you. We’ve provided you with a simple super charger. Run
            faster, and you’ll get a shot to use against the zombies. Good luck! Start running now!
            You have at least a minute before a zombie will begin to chase you.

            Watch out, there is a zombie behind you! Look at your wrist gadget and act quickly to
            defeat the them. If you’ve got a shot, you can take it. Otherwise, you can act like a
            zombie in order to blend in.  Or, throw an axe at the zombie. Choose wisely.

            There’s a fork in the road ahead. We have intel suggesting that a zombie mans the split.
            One of the paths leads to a bunker, and that bunker has a hard drive we need you to get.
            Don’t worry if you can’t find it right away - but know that the zombie may pursue if you
            get their attention. If you take care of them quickly, they might have something on
            their person. Or is it just a body since they are dead? Undead? Anyway, it will tell you
