[Games in Motion][] is a simple game that motivates you to run. It is developed
entirely using [Android Studio][].

## Motivation

[Games in Motion][] is a demonstration for several Android-specific
technologies, including the [Google Fit][] API, the [Android Wear][] API, and a
simple data-driven design mechanic. It is also compatible with
[Material design][]. This sample shows how all these pieces can be put together
in a fun context, while also giving players a good motivation to exercise.

In addition, [fplutil][] is used to build the documentation of this project.
