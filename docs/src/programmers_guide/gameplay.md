Gameplay {#games_in_motion_guide_gameplay}
===============

The player selects a mission to play and exercises (walk or run) while receiving
audio cues on gameplay.

In order to fulfill the player's exercise goals, they can select an interval
speed they want to challenge. If the player wants to listen to music while
running, they can switch over to their favourite music app and start playing the
music before starting a mission.

While on a mission, the player listens to the backstory of the mission and makes
choices via an [Android Wear][] device or the notifications menu of their phone
or tablet. If the player has been consistently running at the interval speed,
they will be rewarded with extra choices.

The app presents exercise statistics when the mission completes and uploads the
data to [Google Fit][].
