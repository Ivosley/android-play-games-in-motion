Gameplay {#games_in_motion_guide_gameplay}
===============

The player selects a mission to play and exercises (walk or run) while receiving
audio cues on gameplay.

The player can customize their experience based on their fitness level and
goals. In order to fulfill the player's exercise goals, they can select an
interval speed they want to challenge. If the player wants to listen to music
while running, they can switch over to their favourite music app and start
playing the music before starting a mission.

While on a mission, the player listens to mission details, learning about the
story and what the game goals are. When it comes time to interact with the game,
the player will make choices by tapping or swiping on their [Android Wear][]
device or the notifications menu of their phone or tablet.

If the player has been consistently running at the interval speed,
they will be rewarded with extra choices.

Upon completion of the mission, the app presents the statistics of the exercise
and uploads the data to [Google Fit][].
